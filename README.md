# Hypertone

**This project is incomplete! Use whatever you need.**

## Setup

First, you'll need to install Stack. Here's an example using Homebrew:

```
brew update
brew install haskell-stack
```

Alternatively, you can follow instructions on The Haskell Tool
Stack [README](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

Next, clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/nspotrepka/hypertone.git
cd hypertone
```

Finally, you can build and run it:

```
stack build
stack exec hypertone-exe
```

## Usage

This project is not finished! I've abandoned the project in favor of using C++,
but I've chosen to upload this code as a solid reference on how to use HSC3
together with Tidal. Can be super useful for live coding. This project also uses
Gloss, which is a wonderful library as well.
